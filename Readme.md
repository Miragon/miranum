## About The Project

Miranum Platform is an open source production ready process automation platform with a focus on human-task driven
processes.
Many components of this repository are based on the [DigiWF project](https://github.com/it-at-m/digiwf-core).

## Use-Cases

Miranum Platform is a solution for complex human task management workflows.
With its unified Tasklist and JSON-based forms it represents a generic approach to task management,
suitable for automating many different processes.
Besides it provides all necessary components for task management purposes such as the Minio S3 storage
as well as Keycloak.

Even though Miranum Platform was created out of a project in the public sector it can be used versatile in many
different
industries. Whenever you deal with human task management and need a centralized Tasklist, Miranum Platform is a possible
choice.

## Platform Overview

Miranum Platform uses Camunda 7 as process engine with Polyflow for task handling.
In addition, system components such as Keycloak, Nginx, PostgreSQL and Minio are being used.
The latter tools are interchangeable but work best in the current version.
