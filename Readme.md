## About The Project

Miranum Platform is an open source production ready process automation platform with a focus on human-task driven
processes.
Many components of this repository are based on the [DigiWF project](https://github.com/it-at-m/digiwf-core).

## Use-Cases

Miranum Platform is a solution for complex human task management workflows.
With its unified Tasklist and JSON-based forms it represents a generic approach to task management,
suitable for automating many different processes.
Besides it provides all necessary components for task management purposes such as the Minio S3 storage
as well as Keycloak.

Even though Miranum Platform was created out of a project in the public sector it can be used versatile in many
different
industries. Whenever you deal with human task management and need a centralized Tasklist, Miranum Platform is a possible
choice.

## Platform Overview

Miranum Platform uses Camunda 7 as process engine and provides a set of components to build a complete process automation application.
The platform is designed to be modular and can be used as a whole or in parts.
Each component is build as a hexagonal module that enables the user to replace the default implementation with a custom one. 

Components:

- **Engine-Core** includes [Camunda Platform 7](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform) and providers core APIs for process execution.
- **Engine-Task** contains task management apis.
- **Engine-User**: contains a user management abstraction layer.

## Get Started
