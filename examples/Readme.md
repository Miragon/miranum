# Process Integration Example

This project shows how to use miranum connect and miranum plaform. 
To execute the example start the service in the following way:

1. stack
2. Miranum Platform SDU 
3. Inquiry Integration Service

Use the `inquiry-integration-service/inquiry.http` to work on the user tasks and simulate customer mails.

## Troubleshooting
### Missing EnvFile plugin
To start MiranumPlatformSDU and InquiryIntegrationService you can use the run-scripts,
but you need to have the [EnvFile-Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7861-envfile) installed in your IDE.
